A project activity for [Girls Into Coding](https://www.girlsintocoding.com/)

This session is designed to be fun! The idea is that we can follow it together in a class, but that we can also be free to move at our own pace. We're going to be doing some basic python programming in this activity. You also have the opportunity to use the make code block based programming language. So whatever your level, you have lots of options! 

The idea with this acitivity isn't to become an ACE programmer inside 2 hours, but it's just to get an **appreciation** of programming robots. So that you can use this knowledge for good in the future :)!

## First lets check you have the right equipment, you should find the following items in your box

* 1 x Micro:bit
* 1 x USB cable
* 1 x Kitronik robotics board
* 1 x Battery pack
* 1 x Sound level indicator (wooden laser cut)
* 1 x Servo motor and stand
* 1 x Servo motor arm

## About the Micro:bit
If you haven't used one before then take a look at this video

<iframe width="852" height="479" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u2u7UJSRuko" title="Introduction to the BBC micro:bit" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>

## Go to Microsoft MakeCode
* Plug your microbit into the computer using the supplied usb lead
* Browse to the website [https://makecode.microbit.org/](https://makecode.microbit.org/)
* Click on *New Project*
* Name it 'helloWorld' or something else you choose

## Tour of Microsoft MakeCode
* Simulator - on the left side of the screen, you will see a virtual micro:bit that will show what your program will look like running on a micro:bit. This is helpful for debugging, and instant feedback on program execution. 
* Toolbox - in the middle of the screen, there are a number of different categories, each containing a number of blocks that can be dragged into the programming workspace on the right.
* Workspace - on the right side of the screen is the Programming Workspace where you will create your program. Programs are constructed by snapping blocks together in this area.

[![ideTour](images/ide-tour.png)](https://makecode.microbit.org/)

The features highlighted here are:

1. Go to the Home Screen to start a new project or open an existing project
2. Simulator shows what your program will look like when running on a micro:bit
3. Hide or Show the simulator pane
4. Program in either Blocks or JavaScript
5. Programming Workspace where you will build you program
6. Blocks Toolbox
7. Download your program to the micro:bit
8. Name your project and Save it on your computer


*Note: in all of the following activities you can choose to use python or MakeCode blocks for programming the micro:bit. Choose whatever you feel is the right language for your level*

[![languageChange](images/change_makeCode_language.png)](https://makecode.microbit.org/)

## How to download your code to your micro:bit
There are two options (explained on this [page](https://microbit.org/get-started/first-steps/set-up/)). If you don't know - just ask a mentor

### Let's write our first program

* You can select you programming language from the top of the page. To select python click on the dropdown and select python.
* Let's write some code to make the microbit display a smiley face when the program starts
* When you have finished - download it to you micro:bit (follow the instructions here)

<div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:70%;overflow:hidden;"><iframe style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" src="https://makecode.microbit.org/#pub:_WPcUfoRfpUpg" frameborder="0" sandbox="allow-popups allow-forms allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
<br>

### Let's make the face change
* Microcontrollers work using a 'forever loop'
* Let's write a function to make the face switch between sad and happy in the forever loop

<div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:70%;overflow:hidden;"><iframe style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" src="https://makecode.microbit.org/#pub:_8e016aKRbcUx" frameborder="0" sandbox="allow-popups allow-forms allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
<br>

### Let's program a button input
* We can use buttons as inputs
* Let's use the following to nake the face switch between happy and sad:
  * Buttons
  * An if statement
  * A variable called 'state'

<div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:70%;overflow:hidden;"><iframe style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" src="https://makecode.microbit.org/#pub:_JRh2FkicqE9U" frameborder="0" sandbox="allow-popups allow-forms allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>

<!--Comment: Back to markdown -->

### Measure sound using the microbit
* Write the program below
   * This uses serial communication to send the sound value the micro:bit measures back to the computer so that we can look at the value it on the computer screen. (We can imagine this like the microbit having a conversation with the computer)

<div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:70%;overflow:hidden;"><iframe style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" src="https://makecode.microbit.org/#pub:_H2MCuTK7gUHt" frameborder="0" sandbox="allow-popups allow-forms allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>
<br>

### Now check the program works!
* There are some instructions in the image below
   * Try it out in the simulator first
   * Then try it out for real on your micro:bit
      * **Note** *you need to be [connected](https://microbit.org/get-started/first-steps/set-up/) to the micro:bit for this to work*
* Make a note
   * What sound values did you see in real life?
   * What was the maximum? What was the minimum?

<div class="container">
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo7a">Question</button>
  <div id="demo7a" class="collapse" markdown="1">
  * What sound values did you see in real life?
  * What was the maximum? What was the minimum?
  </div>
</div>

[![serial_data_on_microBit](images/serial_data.png)]()

### Now lets visualise the sound measurement on the micro:bit
* Write the program below
* This program allows us to plot a graph on the micro:bit leds to show how loud the sound is!
* Check it is working correctly, you can check how it works in the simulator

* We'll be using the [robotbenchmark](https://robotbenchmark.net/) website.
* Click on the **Start** button next to the **Wall Following** activity
* Click on **Start programming this benchmark**
* You should see the scene below


![image1](images/image1.png)


First we're going to get familiar with how we control our view of the 3D simulation. We need to find how many ultrasonic sensors there are! Let's control the viewpoint to count how many ultrasonic sensors there are on the robot.

**Use the mouse to move the viewpoint and count the number of sensors**
* **Rotate:** click on a 3D object in the scene with the left mouse button and drag the mouse pointer. The viewpoint will rotate around the object.
* **Translate:** click in the scene with the right mouse button and drag the mouse pointer.
* **Zoom:** click in the 3D scene and roll the mouse wheel. It is also possible to zoom by pressing the mouse wheel and dragging the mouse forward or backwards.
* **Tilt:** press the mouse wheel over the 3D scene and drag the mouse to the left or to the right. Pressing simultaneously the left and right mouse buttons is equivalent to pressing the mouse wheel.

* We're still going to be using the [Wall Following](https://robotbenchmark.net/benchmark/wall_following/simulation.php) activity at the [robotbenchmark](https://robotbenchmark.net/) website. So you can keep this open all the time!
* We're going to get our robot moving!!
* When you're ready to program the robot, right click on it, and select **Edit controller**

![image2](images/image2.png)

* A window will pop up with python code in it! This is how we program our virtual robot.
* Delete all the code in the robot controller window, by hightlighting it all (or pressing **ctrl-A**) and then pressing **delete**
* Copy and paste the **'Activity Base Code'** code from below (click the green button) into the robot controller window, by hightlighting it all then right clicking and pressing **copy** (or pressing **ctrl+C**)
  
![image3](images/image3.png)

* Start the simulation by following the instrucitons in the image above
* You should see the robot approach the wall, but then reverse quickly when it senses it!
* Have a look at the python functions that are making the robot move in the 'Start of main program' section of the code. We'll discuss these together!

* We're still going to be using the [Wall Following](https://robotbenchmark.net/benchmark/wall_following/simulation.php) activity
* Let's have a look at how the robot is sensing the wall
* Open up the console by following the instructions in the image below, then run the simulation
![image4](images/image4.png)
* The console is where the robot prints messages to us!
* Let's discuss what it is saying
* Every 0.5 seconds we are asking the robot to tell us the distance of any objects from it's ultrasonic sensors
* It is telling us the distance by printing this to the console
* The diagram below shows how they work!

[![image6](images/image6.png)](images/image6.png)


**Questions**
*Let's answer these questions as a group*
* Can you see the moment at which the robot detects the distance to the wall? 
* How does the robot detect the wall?
* What should the robot do when it detects a wall?

* Let's discuss this code together.
* How would we change the code so that when the robot changes direction (from fowards to backwards) then it prints our name e.g. "hello there ..."?
* How would we make the robot move backwards less far?

* What would we do if we wanted to change the movement of the robot so that it starts to avoid walls? 
* Let's alter the code together to make this happen! Our goal is to make the robot turn after it has moved backwards
* Open the 'controller' (code editor) for the robot
* Scroll to the section of the code which looks like this (it should be lines 168-189):

```python
# ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
# ~~~~ MAKE YOUR EDITS BELOW HERE ~~~
# ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
    
    
print("hello there Nikita")
    
# Move backward 
startMoveBackward(5)
# Keep going for 2 seconds
milliSeconds = 0
while True:
    robot.step(500)
    milliSeconds = milliSeconds + 500
    direction, distance = getClosestObjectToRobot()
    print("time = {}").format(milliSeconds) 
    # If the time is longer than 2 seconds, then stop moving!
    if milliSeconds > 2000:
        break
    
    
# ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
# ~~~~ END OF YOUR CODE EDITS ~~~
# ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
```

* Let's discuss this code together.
* How would we change the code so that robot turns when it has finished going backwards?
* Have a look at the hint to make a start!

* Our goal is to make the robot behaviour so that it randomly explores the map!
* To keep going for ever it will need to avoid walls, and keep repeating behaviours
* We could do this with loops! But it can get a bit complicated.
* A really powerful idea for robot behaviours are state machines
* It might sound scary but it's really not!! Let's take a look at what a state machine is together ! 
  
[![image7](images/image7.png)](images/image7.png)

* As we can see in the images, we just have some robot behaviours, and we call them states!
* We've already created these robot behaviours, so there's not much more to do
* Let's have a look at one kind of program structure for a state machine in python
* Here is some pseudo code which shows how it works

[![image8](images/image8.png)](images/image8.png)

* So let's implement this for the robot simulation together!
* Delete all the code in the robot controller window, by hightlighting it all (or pressing **ctrl-A**) and then pressing **delete**
* Copy and paste the **'State Machine Code'** code from below (click the green button) into the robot controller window, by hightlighting it all then right clicking and pressing **copy** (or pressing **ctrl+C**)
  
![image3](images/image3.png)

* Start the simulation by following the instrucitons in the image above
* You should see the robot have the behaviours we programmed in the state machine
* Have a look at the python functions that are making the robot move in the **'Our States'** and **'Our State Machine'** section of the code

* The state machine allows us to very easily change the behaviour of the robot!
* Let's change the behaviour to make a state machine that does the following
* (1) Go towards wall (2) Make a 360 degree spin (3) Go backwards away from wall (4) Repeat
* How would we change the code to do this? 
* First let's make the spin happen!
* Have a look at the robotSpin() function, you can see this below
* How can you change the time value to make the robot spin 360 degree (one complete turn?)

```python

* Now lets look at the state machine
* How can we change the transition conditions to change the order of behaviours? 
* What we want to achieve is shown in the image below
* Notice the change in arrow directions !!
